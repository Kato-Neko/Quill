    Category selection dropdown (Work, Personal, Learning, etc.). 
    Content editor (plain text entry).
    Save button in the top right.
    Created date visible at the bottom.

    Categorization of notes (Work, Personal, Learning).

5. Visual / UX Features

UX polish (quick wins)

Empty states: friendly text and a “New note” CTA in each list.

Toasts/snackbars for Save/Archive/Trash/Restore/Permanently delete.

Autosave every 2–3s while editing; show “Saved • 3:42 PM”.

Keyboard shortcuts: N (new), / (focus search), P (pin), S (star), E (edit), Del (trash).

Search: debounce 250ms; highlight matches in cards.

Sorting: Recent, A→Z, Pinned first (default).

Checklist / To-Do: add a “Checklist” block type (checkbox markdown - [ ] works great).

Confirmations as real modals: use a consistent AlertDialog component with primary/secondary buttons, escape to close.



Addition Info: 

Testing checklist

    1. Create → Save → Appears in “All Notes” and correct category.

    2. New screen shows no Archive/Trash.

    3. Edit screen shows Archive/Trash; Archive sends note to Archive list and back via Unarchive.

    4. Trash flow: move to trash → appears in Trash → Restore works → Delete forever uses modal and removes item.

    5. Pinned shows a “Pinned” section; unpin moves it to Others.

    6. Star toggle persists; “Starred” filter shows only starred actives.

    7. Sidebar counts match the actual queries.

    8. Search finds by title & body; category filters + search combine correctly.

    9. Archive and Trash pages are routable and load even on refresh (deep links).

    10. Keyboard shortcuts work and are announced in a help tooltip.



Nice-to-haves

    - Bulk actions (multi-select for archive/trash/pin/star).

    - Note history (versions) and undo.

    - Reminders/notifications.
